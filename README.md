# Daily Scheduler

Work day scheduler that presents a nice background image depicting a brand new day with date and button to open scheduler. Once inside scheduler the user can enter information into the form field by clicking on it and save information by hitting the file archive icon to store into local storage to be recalled upon refreshing page. Depending on time of day the form field will display gray to represent past, green for present, and red for future.

## Lessons Learned

After observing the option to utilize multiple htmls and scripts I wanted to utilize it in this project. It was confusing at times because I had accidentally left doubles of the main html inside the assets folder as well as in the main root folder so I was confused as to which one I was accessing. In the future I need to promptly delete any irrelevant files because I struggled for an hour and realized I was looking at the wrong html file. Otherwise, the htmls and scripts function beautifully how I hoped it would. By utilizing multiple htmls and scripts I was able to forego multiple hidden and revealed divs like I did in the code quiz and instead just change the entire html to go from the landing page to the main page that has the actual scheduler. I see the advantages of both and I'll need to experiment more to see which way works better for which projects. Due to sparse syntax I might have been better off sticking to multiple hidden revealed divs for this project as well, but it was a success regardless. I unfortunately ran out of time and could not bootstrap mobile friendly port as I intended.
